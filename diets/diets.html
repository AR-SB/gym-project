            Keto Diet came from “Ketogenic” which is  a term for a low-carb diet (like the Atkins diet). The idea is for you to get more calories from protein and fat and less from carbohydrates. You cut back most on the carbs that are easy to digest,
            like sugar, soda, pastries, and white bread.When you eat less than 50 grams of carbs a day, your body eventually runs out of fuel (blood sugar) it can use quickly. This typically takes 3 to 4 days. Then you’ll start to break down protein and fat for energy, which can make you lose weight. This is called ketosis.
            It's important to note that the ketogenic diet is a short term diet that's focussed on weight loss rather than the pursuit of health benefits.
            People use a ketogenic diet most often to lose weight, but it can help manage certain medical conditions, like epilepsy, too. It also may help people with heart disease, certain brain diseases, and even acne, but there needs to be more research in those areas. Talk with your doctor first to find out if it’s safe for you to try a ketogenic diet, especially if you have type 1 diabetes.
            A ketogenic diet may help you lose more weight in the first 3 to 6 months than some other diets. This may be because it takes more calories to change fat into energy than it does to change carbs into energy. It’s also possible that a high-fat, high-protein diet satisfies you more, so you eat less, but that hasn’t been proved yet.
            Insulin is a hormone that lets your body use or store sugar as fuel. Ketogenic diets make you burn through this fuel quickly, so you don’t need to store it. This means your body needs -- and makes -- less insulin. Those lower levels may help protect you against some kinds of cancer or even slow the growth of cancer cells. More research is needed on this, though.
            Low-carb diets seem to help keep your blood sugar lower and more predictable than other diets. But when your body burns fat for energy, it makes compounds called ketones. If you have diabetes, particularly type 1, too many ketones in your blood can make you sick. So it’s very important to work with your doctor on any changes in your diet.
            Ketogenic diets have helped control seizures caused by this condition since the 1920s. But again, it’s important to work with your doctor to figure out what’s right for you or your child. 
            A ketogenic diet may help endurance athletes -- runners and cyclists, for example -- when they train. Over time, it helps your muscle-to-fat ratio and raises the amount of oxygen your body is able to use when it’s working hard. But while it might help in training, it may not work as well as other diets for peak performance.
            Like evrey thing in this world it have some side effects:You might have constipation, mild low blood sugar, or indigestion. Much less often, low-carb diets can lead to kidney stones or high levels of acid in your body (acidosis). Other side effects can include the "keto flu," which may include headache, weakness, and irritability; bad breath; and fatigue.
            When your body burns its stores of fat, it can be hard on your kidneys. And starting a ketogenic diet -- or going back to a normal diet afterward -- can be tricky if you’re obese because of other health issues you’re likely to have, like diabetes, a heart condition, or high blood pressure. If you have any of these conditions, make diet changes slowly and only with the guidance of your doctor.

            The Mediterranean Diet is a way of eating that emphasizes plant-based foods and healthy fats.
            In general, if you follow a Mediterranean Diet, you’ll eat:
            Lots of vegetables, fruit, beans, lentils and nut,Lots of whole grains, like whole-wheat bread and brown rice,Plenty of extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) as a source of healthy fat,
            A moderate amount of fish, especially fish rich in omega-3 fatty acids,A moderate amount of cheese and yogurt,Little or no meat, choosing poultry instead of red meat,
            Little or no sweets, sugary drinks or butter,A moderate amount of wine with meals (but if you don’t already drink, don’t start).
            A dietitian can help you modify this diet as needed based on your medical history, underlying conditions, allergies and preferences.
            There are many definitions of the diet (each with slightly different goals for servings). That’s because the diet focuses on overall eating patterns rather than strict formulas or calculations. It’s also based on eating patterns across many different Mediterranean countries, each with their own nuances. 
            Because there’s no single definition, the Mediterranean Diet is flexible, and you can tailor it to your needs.
            Benfits if this diet include:Lowering your risk of cardiovascular disease.Supporting a body weight that’s healthy for you.
            Supporting healthy blood sugar, blood pressure and cholesterol.Lowering your risk of metabolic syndrome.
            Supporting a healthy balance of gut microbiota (bacteria and other microorganisms) in your digestive system.
            Lowering your risk for certain types of cancer.Slowing the decline of brain function as you age.Helping you live longer.
            Cardiologists often recommend the Mediterranean Diet because extensive research supports its heart-healthy benefits. One study (published in 2018) looked at people at high risk of cardiovascular disease over a five-year period. These people were split into two groups. One group followed the Mediterranean Diet, and the other group followed a low-fat diet. The Mediterranean Diet group had a 30% lower relative risk of cardiovascular events compared to the low-fat diet group. Such events included heart attack, stroke or cardiovascular-related death.
            Researchers believe these protective benefits are partly due to the healthy fats you eat with the Mediterranean Diet. These come from foods like olive oil, nuts and fish.
            You may have many questions as you begin a new eating plan. It’s important to consult with a primary care physician or dietitian before making drastic changes to your diet or trying any new eating plan. They’ll make sure your intended plan is best for you based on your individual needs. They’ll also share meal plans and recipes for you to try at home.
            As you get started, you might wonder how much you can modify the Mediterranean Diet without losing its benefits. Remember that the Mediterranean Diet is a general approach to eating. It’s not a strict diet with hard and fast rules. As a result, you can adapt it to suit your needs (ideally with a dietitian’s help).
            To get the most from your eating plan, try to:Exercise regularly, ideally with others.Avoid smoking or using any tobacco products.
            Prepare and enjoy meals with family and friends.Cook more often than you eat out.Eat locally sourced foods whenever possible.

            Vegan diet:Research has shown that a vegan diet can help do the following:
            Promote weight loss,Reduce your risk of heart disease by lowering cholesterol levels,Lower your chances of getting certain types of cancer, such as colon cancer,Manage diabetes by lowering A1C levels
            But as Soble would tell any of his patients considering it themselves, going vegan doesn't automatically guarantee good health.
            To have a healthy diet of any kind, you need important nutrients. While many of these may have been plentiful when you ate dairy and meat, you'll need to find new ways to incorporate them into your diet as a vegan.
            Protein: Animals aren't the only sources of protein. Soy products (e.g., tofu and edamame) are also packed with protein. Other good sources include seitan (made from gluten), chickpeas, lentils and nutritional yeast.
            Vitamin B12: A lack of vitamin B12 can make you feel tired and weak. Getting enough vitamin B12, though, can be challenging for vegans because it can't be found in plants.  To get your fill, stock up on fortified cereals, fortified rice and soy drinks — or take a supplement. The recommended daily amount for most adults is about 2.4 milligrams, but check with your doctor to see what's right for you.
            Essential fatty acids: A lack of essential fatty acids has been associated with problems related to brain heath, such as cognitive impairment and depression. To get your essential fatty acids, pile up the whole grains and leafy green vegetables (e.g., kale, spinach and collards). And try snacking on a small handful of unsalted nuts, like almonds, walnuts or pistachios (just watch your portions; nuts are high in calories).
            Iron: Red meat and egg yolks reign as the richest sources of iron. But they also are high in cholesterol. Good plant sources of iron include black-eyed peas, tofu and dried fruits (fresh fruit has iron, too, you just get more iron from dried fruit because you eat more).
            Vitamin D: Ten to 15 minutes of sunlight exposure a day can give you a vitamin D boost, as can fortified orange juice and soy.
            Feel ready to make the change? To ease your transition, Soble offers a few suggestions:
            ,Talk to your partner first. Explain your reasons for making the change. Your partner may decide to make the journey with you, or you may have to go it alone. If you do choose to eat differently, discuss how that will work in terms of shopping, meal preparation and dining out.
            ,Take notes. Write down which vegan foods you've enjoyed in the past and where to get them. This can include prepared meals from your local grocer, your preferred brand of soy yogurt or tasty entrées at nearby restaurants. This handy list will help with last-minute meal planning, and help take the stress out of shopping and dining.
            ,Understand your own expectations. Will you ensure that every item you eat has no animal products by reading ingredient labels? Or will you take a different approach and have a little ice cream at birthday parties? Veganism doesn't have to be all or nothing. Take a close look at your goals and objectives and do what works best for you. "By creating your own roadmap and being realistic about what you want to achieve, you'll be more satisfied with making the change," Soble says.,Remove hurdles. Can't go vegan because there's no Whole Foods or Trader Joe's nearby? These days, you don't need a gourmet or organic grocery store to shop vegan, Soble says. "In Chicago, more chain stores are opening in underserved communities and offering not only fresh produce but soy products as well," he says. Farmer's markets are also more plentiful. And, you don't need to have organic foods or even fresh produce to be a vegan. Frozen vegetables and fruits can also be part of a vegan diet.

            A paleo diet is an eating plan based on foods humans might have eaten during the Paleolithic Era. The Paleolithic Era dates from around 2.5 million to 10,000 years ago.
            A modern paleo diet includes fruits, vegetables, lean meats, fish, eggs, nuts and seeds. These are foods that in the past people could get by hunting and gathering. It doesn't include foods that became more common when small-scale farming began about 10,000 years ago. These foods include grains, legumes and dairy products.
            Other names for a paleo diet include Paleolithic diet, Stone Age diet, hunter-gatherer diet and cave man diet.
            The purpose of a paleo diet is to eat foods likely eaten by early humans. The diet is based on the idea that our genes are not well adjusted for modern diets that grew out of farming.
            Farming made foods such as grains and legumes more easily available. And it introduced dairy. Also, farming changed the diets of animals that people ate. The paleo diet idea is that these changes in diet outpaced the human body's ability to change, or adapt. This mismatch is believed to contribute to obesity, diabetes and heart disease today.
            What to eat: Fruits,Vegetables,Nuts and seeds,Eggs,Lean meats, especially grass-fed animals or wild game,Fish, especially those rich in omega-3 fatty acids, such as salmon, mackerel and albacore tuna,Oils from fruits and nuts, such as olive oil or walnut oil
            What to avoid:Grains, such as wheat, oats and barleyLegumes, such as beans, lentils, peanutsDairy products, such as milk and cheese,Refined and added sugar,Added saltStachy vegetables, such as corn, jicama, peas and white potatoes
            Highly processed foods, such as chips or cookies
            In general, a paleo diet has many features of recommended healthy diets. Common features the paleo diet has include the emphasis on fruits, vegetables, lean meats and the avoidance of processed foods. But there is limited research on paleo diets compared with studies of balanced diets with more varied food groups.
            Most studies of paleo diets included small numbers of people. Also, they only lasted from a few weeks to a few months. The definitions of the diet also vary from one study to another. So it's hard to say for sure what people can expect, especially over time.
            In general, short-term, small studies suggest a paleo diet might help manage:Weight loss,Blood pressure,Cholesterol,Triglycerides
            One large study looked at the benefits of self-reported, long-term dietary patterns in young adults from Spain. The researchers found that the paleo diet was linked to lower heart disease, or cardiovascular, risk factors. The lower risk mostly came from avoiding highly processed foods, such as chips and candy, and eating lots of fruits and vegetables.
            Longer trials with large groups of people randomly assigned to different diets are needed to understand the long-term, overall health benefits and possible risks of a paleo diet.
